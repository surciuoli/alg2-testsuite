# alg2-testsuite
A tool for comparing the result of the output generated by running some program (which reads a problem case from stding and outputs its soluction to stdout) against a list of files, where each of one contains the expected output for one of the problems

## Usage:
For usage, type the following command in a bash shell: 

```./test.sh PROG CASES [OUTPUT_DIR]``` 

where:
* PROG must be a valid executable file. Is the program to be tested."
* CASES must be a valid directory where cases are present. It must contains the problems and its solutions, each of one in two separated files with the same name and `in.txt` and `out.txt` extensions, respectively."
* OUTPUT if present, must also be a directory where output files will be saved. If it not exists, it will be created. If not present, CASES is used."

For example, let's say we have a `cases` directory with the following four files:
* case1.in.txt
* case1.out.txt
* case2.in.txt
* case2.out.txt

For every problem named `P`, `P.in.txt` and `P.out.txt` must represent its codification and solution's codification, respectively. So, for example, `case1.in.txt` is the input and `case1.out.txt` the *expected* output for the first problem, named it, `case1`.

In sum, to test a program, name it `S`, which supposedly solves every problem, we may use the following command:

```./test.sh S cases```

Which will answer if `S` outputs exactly the same as in `cases/P.out.txt` for every single case `cases/P.in.txt`. Since we have not passed any output directory, ours problems output is saved in the same directory `cases` under the name `P.mine.txt` for every single problem case P.

So, in essence, after the execution our `cases` directory is modified so:
* case1.in.txt
* case1.mine.txt
* case1.out.txt
* case2.in.txt
* case1.mine.txt
* case2.out.txt

And the script tell us if some error or differences occurred.
